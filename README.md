# Overview üëÄ

ChatBot Shop is a React Native app that uses a cloud-based large language model to help users 
search for products and get detailed information. It provides product details. Simply type 
your query, and the chatbot will respond with product info.

I created this app to enhance my skills as a software engineer by integrating AI-powered 
tools into practical applications, improving user experiences in e-commerce.

# Development Environment üèîÔ∏è

To develop ChatBot Shop, I used React Native as the primary framework, ensuring a smooth 
cross-platform experience for both iOS and Android devices. The development process was 
supported by tools like Visual Studio Code for coding, Git for version control, and Expo 
as a framework for react native. These tools streamlined development, making it easier 
to build and debug features efficiently.

The app was built using JavaScript as the core programming language, leveraging the 
flexibility of React Native. Key libraries came from Expo utilities tools, Axios for API integration 
with the cloud-based LLM, and CSS for styling. These libraries provided essential functionality, 
enabling the app to be responsive, robust, and easy to maintain.

# Future Work üö®

* Improve the integration with the LLM to provide more precise and context-aware responses 
to user queries.
* Introduce filtering and sorting options to allow users to browse products by categories 
or features.
* Refine the app's design and navigation for a more intuitive and visually appealing user 
experience.
* Implement robust error messages and fallback mechanisms for scenarios like API failures 
or unsupported queries.
* Add features to track user interactions and preferences to optimize chatbot responses 
and app performance.
